* Select `Import project from external model` and use the `Maven` option
* Use the default options for the Project
* You will need to add the following to the POM file
    ``` xml
    <orderEntry type="module-library" scope="RUNTIME">
      <library>
        <CLASSES>
          <root url="file://$MODULE_DIR$/src/main/resources" />
        </CLASSES>
        <JAVADOC />
        <SOURCES />
      </library>
    </orderEntry>
    ```
* Using the `Run` menu and select `Edit Configurations...`. Use the `+` to add an `Application` configuration.
